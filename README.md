## Synopsis
This is a simple implementation of printf function that formats and prints data

## Description

The function _printf main focus is to print an output according to a certain format. Different ways to print an output is with the use of a format specifier.

### What is format specifier?

A format specifier in c are used to take input and print the output of a type. The symbol we use in every format specifier is %. The specifier tells the compiler about the type of data that most be given or input and the type of data that most be printed on the screen.

## Technology

The language we use for the creation of _printf() is the C language. This low level language allow us to create and control function from scratch and define its output. We are currently in our foundation trimester of C language and we are testing our knowledge by building the _print() from scratch.
